    <h2>The NRDC Quality Control Application</h2>
    <p>
    	The Nevada Research Data Center (NRDC) is a data portal aimed at collecting <br>
    	environmental data from remote sensing sites spread throughout the state. <br>
    	This data streams from physical data loggers that are placed in locations <br>
    	far from human occupancy. As such, these loggers are vulnerable to the <br>
    	mercy of wildlife or environmental harm. These actions would in the end <br>
    	cause inaccurate readings streamed to the central NRDC database. However <br>
    	these erroneous data points cannot go unattended. The NRDC aims to provide <br>
    	the broader scientific community with a quality data product. As such, the <br>
    	NRDC Quality Control (QC) Application comes into play. The QC Application <br>
    	provides data stewards and technicians whom are affiliated with the project<br>
    	the ability to set controlled tests and indicate erroneous data with flags.<br>
    	This flagging of data is then managed autonomously (and sometimes manually) <br>
    	and erroneous is then removed.
